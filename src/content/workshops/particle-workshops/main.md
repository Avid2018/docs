# Getting Started with Particle Workshops

---

Particle workshops are hands on explorations of the Particle ecosystem, from hardware, to the Particle Device OS, Cloud, basics of writing firmware, and more!

When conducted in-person, workshops are led by Particle employees or community advocates, and are designed to give developers new to IoT development the hands-on training they need to confidently build their own IoT solutions, at home, work, and beyond!

Workshops are broken into group presentations intermixed with hands-on labs that reinforce presentation content. Some of the workshops published here include embedded versions of slide content that you are free to review in a self-directed manner.

## Do I have to attend a workshop to complete the labs?

This site contains in-depth lab documents that complement in-person presentations delivered by Particle staff. Attendance of a workshop isn't required to follow along with these labs, but they are written with assumption that you're using a specific set of hardware (i.e. A Particle Grove Start Kit, Particle Maker Kit, etc.) to complete the exercises. If you have all of the hardware needed for a given workshop, you can follow-along with the labs anywhere!

## Self-Guided Workshops
