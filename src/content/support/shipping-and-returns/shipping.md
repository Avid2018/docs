Particle Shipping
===



If you're here, a Particle product must be on it's way to you! Congratulations! 

### Shipping Timing and Tracking


#### Timing

Orders typically ship within 2 business days unless the items you purchased are on preorder. If your cart contains a preordered item (which will give you an estimated shipping date), your entire order will not ship until all products are available. Please review the product descriptions for the shipping lead times.

#### Tracking your package

Your order confirmation and tracking information will be sent to the email address you used to place the order. If you are having trouble finding your order, please visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io) and let us know. For order changes and cancellations, please also visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io) and let us know as soon as possible. 

Since we try to fulfill and ship orders as quickly as possible, we will do our best to change or cancel your order before it is shipped out but we cannot guarantee that we'll catch it in time. Once it’s been submitted to our logistics company for fulfillment, we are unable to change anything on your order and it will ship according to the original order’s information provided. 

If there are any errors with the shipping address provided, resulting in the shipment being returned to sender, the return shipping cost and restocking fees will be deducted from any refund issued.

Please note these shipping timelines are from ship date not order date. 

#### PO Boxes

Please note that for PO Boxes, there are only 2 options for shipping, Economy (for less than 1lb) and Economy+ (for over 1lb). If you need it quicker, you'll have to choose a different, non-PO Box, address since we only have 1 option with our logistic partner to ship to PO boxes.

#### Sales Tax

Domestic sales tax rates vary depending on location by may include applicable state, city, local, or county taxes. 

To receive sales tax exemption, please visit our [Particle For Good](https://www.particle.io/for-good) site, create a Particle [account](https://login.particle.io/signup?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.particle.io%2F), fill out the application, and attach your tax exempt documentation. Please make a note that you’re simply looking for tax exempt status. You’ll receive an email with a link to our tax exempt store. 

### International Shipping

We ship to your country unless you live in Iran, Iraq, South Sudan, North Korea, Sudan, Cuba, Syria, or any country that is embargoed by the US Government. 

For international orders we only have FedEx at this time. New shipping methods are being added frequently as we work with different partners and carriers. 
- FedEx International Economy - Usually is delivered in 5 Business days or less if placed before 12pm PST
- FedEx International Priority - Usually is delivered in 3 Business days or less if placed before 12pm PST

We ship all our products from Indiana, but we have many distributors around the world (you can find a list of some our international distributors [here](https://www.particle.io/distributors).

#### Duties, Taxes, and Other Import Fees

**Additional charges and fees such as VAT, tariff, handling, brokerage, import, duties, taxes, or customs clearance for international shipments are your responsibility and are not included in shipping and handling costs.** Particle is not responsible for any extra charges once the original package has been shipped. There is no way for Particle (the shipper) to predict your country’s customs/fee habits, so please be prepared to pay the full VAT on the fully declared value of your order as well as any additional fees your country and/or postal service may charge you. There are some services that can estimate the duty or taxes, while they’re not 100% accurate, they can be helpful in estimating the amount. 

**If you choose to refuse your shipment for any reason, you will not be issued a refund.** 

Our shipping and fulfillment is fully automated, and we cannot falsify customs forms in any way. The custom forms will accurately describe the contents and cost of your order. We cannot mark orders as “gift”, “sample”, “educational”, or lower the value in order to bypass these fees. Particle makes the best effort to follow all rules, regulations, and laws for export compliance as shown below. 

### Compliance

#### Particle Product Information

HS Codes - Harmonized commodity descriptions, tariff information, description, data/spec sheets, country of origin, ECCNs are all collected, recorded, and are available upon request. 

#### Export Controls

- Particle makes best efforts to follow the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) guidelines. 
- Particle makes best efforts to export using appropriate ECCN and authorization. 
- Particle has a process for self-assigning ECCNs for its products. 
- Particle has a process for requesting ECCNs for any third party products we sell. 


#### Ordering and Payment

Particle and any affiliated logistics company makes best efforts to screen orders using the Restricted Parties List(s) (RPL). 

FedEx uses software systems for all of its restricted party screening requirements that searches over 30 excluded party lists taken from both U.S. and international sources. These systems identify, investigate, and halt shipments to questionable parties immediately upon entry into our fulfillment system. If you are flagged as potentially being on one of these lists, we will reach out to you to gather additional information to verify your identity. If we do not hear back from you in a timely manner, your order will be cancelled and refunded.  

We ship to your country unless you live in Iran, Iraq, South Sudan, North Korea, Sudan, Cuba, Syria, or any country that is currently embargoed by the US Government.

Additionally, Particle currently does not ship to&dagger;:

Belarus, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Democratic People's Republic Of Korea, Myanmar, Ukraine, Zimbabwe

&dagger;List is revisited from time to time and is subject to change. 


#### Red Flags and Fraudulent Orders

Particle and our internal fulfillment systems look for suspicious or abnormal activities with all transactions. If found, we will inquire and reevaluate the transaction in question. This includes, but is not limited to, shipping/billing mismatches, IP address flags, multiple orders in a short period of time, and any abnormal requests from customers. Requests from customers to change any value on customs or import forms will be denied and the order may be canceled. 
Particle also may use key information such as IP address, shipping/billing addresses, previous orders, email addresses, phone numbers, locations, account age, total value, GeoIP locations, or social media in order to help avoid fraudulent orders. 

#### Chargebacks

Particle follows up, documents, and attempts to discover more information for every chargeback request with the original charge source (Credit Card or PayPal). If a chargeback is requested, all evidence will be provided to the appropriate source in addition to reaching out to the customer who initiated the chargeback for more information. 


### Return to Sender

There are lots of things that can happen in the delivery process, and packages can get held up for reasons that are outside of our control. If your order gets returned to us, we can investigate to determine what happened and act accordingly. 

We'll need to determine the following:

- What shipping address was entered when you placed the order
- The current status of the package (for example, if it is heading back to us or being held at  a shipping facility)
- Whether there are unpaid custom charges, fees, or burdens

If the fault lies with us or our warehouse, Particle will issue the replacement shipment as soon as possible. 

If there are any errors with the shipping address provided or there are unpaid customs fees, resulting in the shipment being returned to sender or held at a shipping facility, the return shipping cost and restocking fees will be deducted from any refund issued. A new order will need to be placed as we’re unable to reship the returned package.


### Invoices

We include a commercial invoice with international orders, but sometimes packages do get held up. The customs office should contact you about this, so let us know at [support.particle.io](https://support.particle.io) if you do require any additional documentation and we’ll get that information as quickly as possible. 

### Shipping Cost

We work hard to lower the shipping rates you see. If they are higher than you expected, there are some things you can do: 

- Consolidate shipments. It costs the same to ship 1 and 5 Photons.
- Use a slower shipping method.
- Use one of our [distributors](https://www.particle.io/distributors).

Please note: All shipping prices include a handling fee but do not include any customs, duty, VAT or other import charges. For more information on that, please visit that section [here](#duties-taxes-and-other-import-fees).

### Any Other Questions

If you have any additional questions that aren’t answered here, please let us know at our [support portal](https://support.particle.io).
