# Mesh Deprecation

Particle is discontinuing development of Particle Mesh, our OpenThread-based mesh networking solution, and will no longer be manufacturing the associated Xenon development board. You can find the deprecation roadmap [here](https://docs.particle.io/reference/discontinued/mesh/).

If you purchased a Xenon or Xenon-based product through a third party distributor you may be eligible for promotional credits to the Particle store. 

How to apply for your promotional credit:

1. Submit a request to our support team [here](https://particle.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
2. Select **Mesh deprecation 2020** in the dropdown
3. Attach a proof of purchase before submitting - proof of purchase includes a screenshot or image of an invoice or receipt

We will review and accept submissions until February 28th, 2020.
